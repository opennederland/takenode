              <p>Governments work on internet copyright laws. Big commercial publishers and digital platforms lobby to shape government policy to their favor. Independent content creators however are hardly involved in this process. TakeNode gives creators a voice.</p>

              <h3>How to use TakeNode?</h3>
              <p><a href="#instructions">Scroll down</a> for a quick step by step introduction. But first, let's answer the question "Why do I need TakeNode?"</p>
              <br>
              <h3>The copyright law changed!</h3>
              <p>In 2021, the European copyright law changed. Your favorite online content sharing platform needs to take more responsibility. By law, they need your consent to host your files and/or prioritize tooling to avoid content on their platform that potentially causes a copyright infringement risk. Realistically this means (new) algorithms will block more content in the future, even before your content is published and accessible to the public. If you ever saw your content disappearing from a platform like YouTube you know how difficult it is to dispute the algorithm's decision.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>So, what is your intention when sharing content?</h3>
              <p>Most creators, at first, are not thinking about new copyright laws or the (didn't read) Terms of Use  presented by the platform. The intention of the creator allowing people to enjoy, adapt and share his/her creative work should be leading.</p>
              <br>
              <h3>That's why we created TakeNode</h3>
              <p>TAKENODE.org offers content creators a practical, power tool to register their 'Terms of Use'. Relevant information about the file, creator and intentions packaged in an unique TakeNode Certificate. Sharing the TakeNode certificate as part of the content offers digital platforms and their users an easy to understand mandate.</p>

                      <p>The main goal of TakeNode is to protect your creative work and give you a voice in the new reality of online content sharing. Based on your content and input we will generate an unique certificate for you: a TakeNode. Share your TakeNode together with your file so platforms and their users instantly understand your 'playing rules'.</p>
                      <p>In the initial step you select your file. We will probably recognize the file format but if incorrect you can override our initial setting.</p>

                      <p>Are you ready to add some personal data? If your prefer to stay anonymous we suggest you use an alias. Of course, if you use your real name or even a full, verified name your TakeNode will be more eligible. To include a verified name we work with IRMA (digital passport). Visit: <a href="https://www.irma.app" target="_blank">https://www.irma.app</a></p>
                      <p>Next to your alias or (verified) name you have the option to add contact details e.g. email, website and/or telephone number. This information will appear on the certificate so only disclose data you want to share with the world.</p>

                      <p>This is the core essence of TakeNode: What are platforms and their users allowed to do with the content you share online?</p>
                      <p>Your choice in this step will be translated to a text in the TakeNode certificate. In the next step (4) you can read the full text. Not happy with the outcome? Go back to this step and pick another option.</p>
