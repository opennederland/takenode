      The file you have selected will be treated as the 'source' file. Based on specific file properties and a Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA 256-bits) we generate an unique File ID. We recommend that you store the source file â€“ unmodified -  somewhere safe. Whenever you present the source file to TakeNode in the future, the exact same File ID will be generated. Useful to prove that at a certain date & time you already had the source file in your possession.
