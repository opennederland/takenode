        Ready! We have created an unique TakeNode certificate containing the most relevant information. We suggest you download the certificate (.txt file) and store it somewhere safe together with the source file.
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect your work online we offer two options: You can copy the certificate and paste the full text in a relevant input field while uploading your file to YouTube, Insta, Facebook etc. Or, you can publish your certificate in our online register. You will instantly get a permanent link to the certificate. Publish the link together with the file on your favorite platform. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Important! At the moment we don't offer a self-service model to delete the TakeNode certificates that you have published in our online register. However, if your unique TakeNode link, certificate ID or File ID is no longer available on your preferred platform, people will have no idea it actually exists.
