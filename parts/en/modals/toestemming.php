        The main question to answer is: What can someone do with your work after you published your file online? Do you allow people to share your work as long as they credit you as the rightsholder? Is it okay if they adapt your work? And what about commercial use? What if someone else finds a clever way to monetize your content? Are you okay with that?

        Is this 'declaration of intent' revocable? In theory, yes. However, if someone â€“ before you make changes - finds your work online and reuses the file under the initial conditions then he/she does nothing wrong, right? So, ask yourself: Which conditions feel comfortable to start with?
